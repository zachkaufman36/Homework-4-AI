    "At this point, professor was quite happy with the results he got by using an LLM to detect unethical behavior. Thanks to his curiosity, he wanted to test out this approach on a variety of harmful prompts. Since he could just filter out words from the judge model's answer to determine whether the an attack was successful or not, he could simply write a for loop to go through all the prompts and test the model out. He found out a benchmark dataset called AdvBench which seemed just perfect for this task. He downloaded the harmful_behaviors.csv (https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks/blob/main/data/advbench/harmful_behaviors.csv) file which contained examples of 100 harmful prompts and took his judge model to the field...
